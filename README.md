# shoe-store-grid

I have a shoe store, and I want to create a list of shoes with 10 items. It should be a grid, and each card must contain the image, price, name, and the possibility to add to the cart. On the top right of the screen, I need a cart icon that counts how many items are on the card. When I click the card button, it should redirect to a page that lists the items in the cart. This list must be a table that shows the name, price, and colour. Below the table, add a button to buy the items, and the action of the button should trigger a javascript alert showing the total price.Â
